# Insult Polyglot - https://ruthenewman.github.io/InsultPolyglot/

Day 15 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (SPA that generates insults in four different languages).

A single-page vanilla JS web application with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css). 
Insults are fetched from the Evil Insult API (https://evilinsult.com/api/) in response to a user click on the relevant button, 
with a temporary message loaded first.

# Disclaimer 

No offense actually intended through this app, it was an attempt to refactor JavaScript to standardise one function for 
varied get requests for multiple calls to the same API (in this case in different languages).
